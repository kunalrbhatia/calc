Calculator application that will perform the calculation on any two given numbers. Basically the application should have a login page(hardcode the username and password on the FE to do the authentication i.e. mock JSON ) followed by two input fields where users can enter the numbers, and there should be buttons like Add, Sub, Mul, Divide. After entering the two numbers and on clicking the button should do an appropriate calculation and the result has to come in a UI. There should be a counter on the second page any user can use this application only for 5 mins after that it should take him back to the login page.
